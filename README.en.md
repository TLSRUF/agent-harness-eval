# agent-harness-eval

[한국어](README.md) | **English**

(To be written: problem -> approach -> headline numbers, in three lines.)

The primary experiment model is claude-haiku-5-5. claude-sonnet-5-5 is used only for a partial comparison run.

This harness blocks external connectors linked to the account from being loaded into the agent, and aborts the run if the tool list differs from the allow-list.

**Core question:** with the same model, how much do success rate and cost change depending on the harness configuration (tool descriptions, verification step, max turns, model)?

## Quick start
1. Python 3.12: `py -3.12 -m venv .venv`, then `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Authentication: `claude login` or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (use only one of the two, never both)
3. `python -m src.agent.smoke`

## Limitations
- The `file_stats` tool counts lines with `str.splitlines()`, so lone CR, U+2028 and similar characters are also treated as line breaks; the evaluation fixtures contain no such characters.
- Easy and medium tasks mostly have min_steps of 2 or less while all hard tasks have 3 or more, so the effect of step count cannot be separated from the effect of task type.
- num_turns and max_turns appear to be counted in tool calls, not model responses (hypothesis: in the day7check runs (5) and the Day 3 experiment, num_turns = tool calls + 1), so max_turns=20 means up to about 19 tool calls. Parallel calls within one response are counted per call.
